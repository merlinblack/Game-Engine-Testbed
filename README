Nigel's wizzy test game engine thingy.
-------------------------------------

** What is it?
This is a one man hobby project, to test out 
game and programming ideas, methods, etc.
Its heading towards first or third person shooter/RPG
but is pretty generic at present.

** License
Er, um. MIT I guess.  Same as Ogre3d 1.7

** Warranty
None whatsoever.  Use at your own risk.


** Features so far:
Uses Ogre3d.
Integrates Lua scripting, including a Lua console.
Some bindings of Ogre3d to Lua, amongst other things.
Basic GUI implemented.


** Planned features:
Physics
Networking - an authoritative game server.


** Running:

You should have looked at the code but:
F12  Emergency stop.  For when you screw up the scripts.
~    Toggle console.
ESC  Same as typing 'quit' as the console.

The console while active eats all key presses except "~".


** Quick Start Compiling:

First make sure you have Ogre3d 1.7, OIS 1.2, Lua 5.1, and Luabind 0.9,
along with their development files.  Also needed is CMake 2.6 or above.

LINUX:
from the base directory where you have either extracted, or git clone'd,
make a directory called "build" or something similar, and move in to it.

mkdir build
cd build

Run CMake, and make

cmake ..
make

Copy a couple of configuration files to your build directory.

cp ../src/*.cfg .

Edit plugins.cfg if required

Run!

./engine

WINDOWS:

This has not been tested at all on windows, but should work in theory.
You will need to know what you're doing!

1. Adjust CMakeLists.txt so it works, and finds everything.
2. Run CMake and generate makefiles or a Visual Studio project or whatever.
3. Make an offering to the programming gods.
4. See what breaks. Fix it.
5. Run!
