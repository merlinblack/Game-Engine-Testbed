Mouse picking of scene objects.
-------------------------------
Implemented as a Lua callable function, given x, and y co-ordinates.

Returns first GameEntity hit, and where. Possibly use a direct Lua thunk to allow use of multiple
return values. 

Change GUI mouse code to return true, if the mouse fell in side a "dialog".  Otherwise false.
